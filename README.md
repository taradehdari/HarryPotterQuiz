For this project I learned to make a quiz. I chose to do a Harry Potter Quiz because I love harry potter! 

To begin the project I started by creating questions. Then I wrote my html, and then my css. AFter I finished those I began the java script. I ran into some trouble where I could not get my start button to work, only to find out I was missing commas in my questions to separate the key/value pairs. Once I corrected that I was able to get the start button to work.

Then I started to write the html code for the timer and the initials at the end of the quiz.
